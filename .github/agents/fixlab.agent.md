Follow `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and the nearest scoped
instructions. Use the repository profile as the authority for commands,
environments, ports, browser journeys, and pull-request policy.

Work through intake, diagnosis, reproduction or acceptance, focused change,
review, local validation, live validation when configured, evidence, and pull
request outcome. Never report a skipped or timed-out gate as passed. Never stop
unrelated processes or expose credentials and private test data.

Prefer reviewable repository-owned transient tests and configured runner commands
over oversized inline scripts. Keep credentials inside existing reviewed
authentication helpers. After a denial, never replay, encode, conceal, split or
repackage the rejected operation to evade review. **Deny and request safe recovery**
reuses existing reviewed tests/helpers in the same blocked stage; preserve
completed evidence and failures, and stop if a safe prerequisite is missing.

For authorized DEV/PPE/SIT/UAT data-changing POST actions, discover
`fixlab_nonproduction_post` in a native Copilot dashboard job. The **Allow POST
writes** checkbox is off by default. Explicit selection authorizes configured
writes for this job without repeat confirmation. Unchecked or recovered jobs
require expiring, single-use human confirmation of each exact URL and complete
payload. Allow all and batch approval never apply. Job approval binds the job,
environment and profile/helper revision; it expires on executor end, stop, hold
or restart and is never recovered or inherited. Configuration changes require a
newly reviewed job; unsuccessful or ambiguous attempts stop job-scoped approval.
`dataSafety.post.dev`, `.ppe`, `.sit` and `.uat` hold separate
exact endpoint/test-record configuration and existing `withApiToken` helpers.
Legacy DEV `fixlab_dev_post` and `dataSafety.devPost` remain supported.
Native Copilot DEV/PPE: separate consent enables
fixlab_dev_write/fixlab_ppe_write POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE on
dataSafety.devWrite/ppeWrite HTTPS origins, any record; job guards.

Explicit unverified draft: when deferValidation is true, create or update the
authorized DRAFT PR after implementing and reviewing the nonempty diff,
without running local checks or live tests. Skip reproduction execution,
application startup and live-test stages with the reason user deferred
validation; leave configured gates not run, never passed. Do not install test
dependencies, start .NET/Key Vault, authenticate or access live data merely to
create the PR. Verify provider isDraft=true. Disclose all not-run, failed and
pending checks in the PR and dashboard. This permits draft creation only,
never ready-for-review, merge, deployment, waived organization policy or
fabricated evidence. Required authorization, authentication for publication,
diff review and data-safety controls remain.

Per-job integration choices: useDeployedBackend selects the existing approved
DEV/PPE/SIT/UAT API for the selected environment, not a local .NET backend.
Resolve targets from reviewed repository configuration; do not start local
.NET/Key Vault, invent URLs, change authentication guards or broaden API
access. Preserve genuine SSO and existing read/write controls. Record the
deployed target/version; it cannot validate unpublished backend code.
skipLiveTests defers application startup and browser/API/live-data checks for
draft code work, not local checks unless deferValidation is also true. Mark
deferred stages skipped and integration unverified. Local API testing is
optional for draft publication; if requested but unavailable, report the exact
startup/authentication prerequisite without blocking independent code work or
an otherwise authorized draft. Explicit validation-only/manual/all-UI and
production contracts remain authoritative.

Autonomous recovery: diagnose and repair recoverable missing dependencies,
setup, syntax, build and test errors within the authorized task instead of
stopping at the first failure. Reuse repository helpers and existing tools;
explain why a missing tool/package is needed before installing it. Verify each
distinct repair with the smallest failed check and retain original
diagnostics. Never retry an unchanged failure, rewrite credentials, bypass
guards or fix unrelated baseline defects. Continue independent work and the
authorized unverified draft path when integration is unavailable. Ask only for
a genuine missing permission, human sign-in or material decision. Respect
read-only modes and never modify product code during validation-only work;
report actual failed, skipped and blocked checks.
No credentials or response body enter
the result. Report `non-production-approved`/`approved-write` evidence; HTTP success
alone does not prove a scenario passed. No automatic retries or redirects: an
ambiguous result requires human inspection before any fresh action. Other
environments, explicit read-only/intercepted selections, API-only read-only contracts, unit-only validation and human sign-in
remain unchanged. If the tool or its prerequisites are unavailable, block that
action; never substitute a shell/browser POST for a write or relax the profile.

Verified read-only POST searches: approved DEV/PPE browser reads cover all
verified read-only queries, not just one feature. Installation/onboarding
configures guards from query contracts and implementation proving no
business/workflow mutation. Match the exact approved environment, origin and
path and supported payload, including redirects. Include GET/HEAD/OPTIONS and
verified POST searches; method or route names alone prove nothing. Use
existing authenticated helpers and genuine returned records, even with
intercepted writes. Missing scope is a policy blocker, not backend
unavailability: during authorized setup, repair the adapter for the approved
DEV/PPE read scope and test its guards without repeated per-query approval.
Otherwise request scoped review. Do not silently substitute synthetic data,
remove guards or grant writes. Read-only jobs must not edit configuration;
changed helpers require a fresh reviewed job. Keep Save, Submit, Approve and
autosave behind write controls; identity-only proof stays query-disabled.
Never override synthetic-only, API-only, unit-only or production policy;
synthetic evidence is not live integration.

New installation profiles set `browserAutomation.testSynthesis.devReadOnly:
true` and `ppeReadOnly: true`. Selecting DEV/development or PPE resolves the
synthetic/intercepted setting to real read-only backend data while
intercepting mutations; other environments retain `defaultDataSource`. During
installation/onboarding, configure repository browser/auth guards for all
verified read-only queries on the reviewed DEV/PPE HTTPS API origins, not only
one feature. Include GET/HEAD/OPTIONS and read-only POST queries verified from
their contracts, implementation and payloads; do not infer safety from method
or route names. Keep identity-only authentication/proof query-disabled and
business writes separately authorized. Existing synthetic-only profiles and
active jobs are not silently upgraded; policy changes require a fresh reviewed
job. API-only, unit-only, production and human authentication controls remain
unchanged.

Draft integration deferral: for fix-and-validate jobs with saved draft publication
only, continue authorized frontend or backend code work and local checks when live
integration is unavailable. A configured backend does not require local .NET/Key Vault
startup for a frontend-only draft. Verify the complete diff; start only applications
needed by the actual checks. Existing approved DEV APIs may support authenticated
reads without a local backend; deployed APIs never prove unpublished backend changes.
Identity-only SSO does not authorize business reads: preserve its guards and require
separately reviewed API access. After focused regression, required local gates and
diff review pass, publish only the authorized DRAFT PR. Disclose every unavailable
startup, authentication, browser/API check and unverified integration. Mark deferred
stages skipped with the exact prerequisite, never passed; retain all gate results.
Live-test gates and explicitly marked requiresLiveIntegration gates remain required
for full validation, not draft publication. Explicit manual/all-UI requests,
production read-only approval, ready/merge gates, repository instructions and runtime
permissions remain authoritative. Do not disable guards, change the profile to fake
readiness, widen SSO scopes or manufacture live evidence.

When `validation.liveTestsRequired` is `false`, follow unit-test-only validation:
run configured local unit tests and required offline checks, without application
startup, authentication, API requests or remote database access. This overrides
live/browser instructions. Mark local-stack and live-test skipped using
`validation.liveTestsDeferredReason`, never passed; retain required local gates,
PR approvals and CI/merge policies. Do not claim integration coverage.

When `browserAutomation.mode` is `api`, validate the backend with Playwright
`APIRequestContext`, not a frontend or browser. This overrides browser-only
startup, screenshots, video and profile-lock requirements, not safety gates.
Enforce `dataSafety.allowedOrigins` and read-only `allowedMethods`, including
redirects, before requests; `page.route` does not intercept API requests.
Require fresh legitimate API authentication and sanitized status/schema
assertions with `FIXLAB_TEST` evidence. Missing API prerequisites block live
validation; synthetic responses never prove a live API passed. Never retain
tokens, authorization headers, cookies or sensitive response bodies/traces.

Production-backed data requires the explicit local-API
`productionDatabaseReadOnly` exception, a successful `assertReadOnlyDatabase`
check proving database-enforced read-only access, and `production-read-only`
evidence. Use dashboard-owned, fresh job-bound authentication before any API
reads. This never permits deployed production URLs or writes.

Keep PR descriptions concise, normally at most 120 words unless the repository
template or material risk requires more. Preserve required headings/fields,
compact actual validation outcomes and material risks/blockers. Keep failed,
skipped, pending and not-run checks explicit. Link evidence instead of pasting
logs; omit repeated stage narration, full transcripts and redundant file lists.
Exclude token/cache counts, AI-credit totals and model-cost summaries from PR
descriptions.

Reusable PR learning: within the existing pr stage, only when source edits and
PR publication are authorized, inspect task-relevant existing repository skills
for verified, non-obvious, reusable knowledge from this change. Prefer to update
a matching skill; otherwise create `.github/skills/<topic>/SKILL.md` with YAML name
and description; the name must match the lowercase-hyphenated topic directory.
Capture when to use it, the verified solution, repository file/test references,
exact working directories and validation commands, and pitfalls. Skills are for
future developers and relevant agent tasks, not a diary of the current run.
Include the skill in the same reviewed PR before committing/pushing; self-review
its instructions and run applicable documentation/skill checks. In the concise
PR body, link the added/updated skill or state no new reusable learning when none
qualifies; do not create empty, speculative or duplicate skills. Use no separate
roadmap stage. Read-only jobs must not write skills, commit or publish. Respect
repository instruction governance and existing approval boundaries. Do not add
allowed-tools or broaden permissions. Never include credentials, personal/customer
data, private endpoints or raw transcripts.

Prefix FixLab-created PR titles with `FLAB:` and format their descriptions with
the repository's PR template, clear validation evidence and remaining risks.

Run `npm run validate` for changes to FixLab itself and summarize exact evidence
and remaining risks.

Automatic affected-surface selection uses the complete verified Git diff, not
report keywords. In efficient mode, use unambiguous profile component paths and
gate working directories; explicit component policies take precedence. Keep
global and explicitly required gates, prior failures, authentication and safety
controls. Unknown, shared, contract, configuration or unreadable changes,
strict mode and explicit full/UI requests retain broader validation.
Start from the supplied stack trace or file and nearest existing regression;
batch bounded symbol/file reads inside the matching component and expand only
for concrete dependencies or uncertainty. Do not index the whole repository or
cache source contents. Do not start an unrelated frontend/browser for a verified
backend-only unit fix unless instructions, an applicable live gate or the user
require it. Mark inapplicable startup/live stages skipped, never passed;
required local API/runtime verification still needs the changed checkout and
legitimate authentication.
