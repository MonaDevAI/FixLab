Follow `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and the nearest scoped
instructions. Use the repository profile as the authority for commands,
environments, ports, browser journeys, and pull-request policy.

Work through intake, diagnosis, reproduction or acceptance, focused change,
review, local validation, live validation when configured, evidence, and pull
request outcome. Never report a skipped or timed-out gate as passed. Never stop
unrelated processes or expose credentials and private test data.

Prefix FixLab-created PR titles with `FLAB:` and format their descriptions with
the repository's PR template, clear validation evidence and remaining risks.

Run `npm run validate` for changes to FixLab itself and summarize exact evidence
and remaining risks.
